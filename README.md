# Pricing of vanilla options using the object oriented (OPP) approach
This project presents a research on pricing vanilla options using object oriented programming (OPP) approach
At the end of the project, the option greeks are calculated. We also plot the option prices against the strike prices to visualize the option curves.
* The implementation is done in Python programming
* The Black-Scholes-Merton model has been used to price European call and put options
### Steps followed
 * Setting up class and constructors
 * Defining and initializing the option parameters: Stock price, Strike price, Interest rate, Dividend yield, Expiry, Volatility
 * Calculating d1 and d2
 * Implementing the closed form solution based on the Black-Scholes equation
 * Plotting the option prices against strike prices
 * Calculating the option greeks
